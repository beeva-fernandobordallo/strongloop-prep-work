- **My First Async I/O**: same as previous but using async file reading method
- **Filtered LS**: obtaining a list of files from a specified directory and filtering according to file extension
- **Make it modular**: same as previous but extracting the 'hard work' to a module. First contact with the module pattern
- **HTTP Client**: creating an http GET request and logging the response

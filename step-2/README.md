## Node School Tuts

Here we will collect the basic nodeschool.io tuts followed in preparation for the node-strongloop-certification.

###### Learn You Node

First tutorial collection. Goes through the very basics:
- **Hello world**: print 'Hello world' to the console
- **Baby Steps**: print a sum of numbers introduced through the terminal on launch
- **My First I/O**: using the file system module to read a file and count it's lines
- **My First Async I/O**: same as previous but using async file reading method
- **Filtered LS**: obtaining a list of files from a specified directory and filtering according to file extension
- **Make it modular**: same as previous but extracting the 'hard work' to a module. First contact with the module pattern
- **HTTP Client**: creating an http GET request and logging the response
- **HTTP Collect**: same as previous but bundling the response chunks
- **Juggling Async**: collecting response from three URLs and printing the in the specified order
- **Time Server**: create a TCP server that returns the current date and time in a specific format
- **HTTP File Server**: create an HTTP server which returns a specified file for every request received
- **HTTP Uppercaserer**: create an HTTP server which returns the BODY received from a POST request as an uppercase string
- **HTTP JSON API Server**: create an HTTP serve which responds to GET request to specific URLs, returning an ISO formatted date sent as a URL query parameter


###### Tower Of Babel

Collection of tutoriales that offers an introduction to the use of ES6 in node programming:
- **Babel Setup**: basic instalation of babel-cli and use of an ES6 template string
- **Class**: Create a class the ES6 way
- **Class Extend**: Create a class and another extending from the previous the ES6 way
- **Modules with name**: Create modules with 'import' and 'export' keywords
- **Modules default export**: Same as previous buy using the 'export default' keywords, easing importing for developers
- **Block scope**: Understanding with simple examples the use of 'let' and 'const' variable declarations
- **Computed property**: Define object computed properties with ES6
- **Iterator for of**: Create an iterator and run over it with the 'For Of' loop
- **Generator**: Same as previous but using a Generator Function
- **Destructure**: Nested Object destructuring example
- **Arrow Function**: Use arrow functions (very little info about them though) in a functional exercise that uses 'map' and 'reduce'
- **Rest and Spread**: Example of use of the spread and rest operators

For an indepth study on ES6 I recommend reading [Understanding ES6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read).


###### Scope, Chains and Closures

>Scope, Scope Chains, Closures, and Garbage Collection all have one thing in common: They're often hand-waved away. How do closures actually work? When does Garbage Collection occur? What really IS a Scope Chain?
>
>In this workshop, we will discover it's not black magic after all; No hand waving is required to explain these language features, in fact you've been using them all along without realising.

- **Scopes**: Extreeeeemely basic example of lexical scope
- **Scope Chains**: Same as previous but includes a nested lexical scope (has info on scopes, both lexical and block, and gives examples of nesting)
- **Global Scope & Shadowing**
- **Closures**
- **Garbage Collection**

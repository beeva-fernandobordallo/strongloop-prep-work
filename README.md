### Step 1  -  Get to know the contents

This is the link to the [Strongloop certification study guide](https://strongloop.com/node-js/certification/scnd-study-guide/#toggle-id-1). Offers a basic overview of what will be expected and has links to pages of interest.

Summaries and notes made from the general contents of this particular link can be found in the folder 'Step 1'. Link to [documents found here](https://github.com/beeva-fernandobordallo/strongloop-prep-work/tree/master/Step%201).

These will only cover the basic concepts required to get a base understanding of what node is and what makes it ... well ... NODE!!! 

In later steps (and individual folders) we will cover Express, Debugging, Clusters, ...

### Step 2 - Learn Node Basics

At this point we have a basic understanding of node and are ready to dive into some hands on work. No place seems better to do this than ['The Node School'](http://nodeschool.io/). In the [Step 2 folder](https://github.com/beeva-fernandobordallo/strongloop-prep-work/tree/master/Step%202) you will find the main tutorial course solutions. Well ... my solutions.
